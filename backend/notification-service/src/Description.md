Title: Building an AI-Enabled Smart Healthcare Appointment & Telemedicine Platform using Microservices

Note: This assignment carries a weightage of 25% towards the final grade. It is a group project with 3 to 4 members.

You have been asked to develop a cloud-native healthcare platform similar to real-world telemedicine systems such as Channeling.lk, oDoc, or mHealth, which allows patients to book doctor appointments, attend video consultations, upload medical reports, and receive AI-based preliminary health suggestions. Below are the requirements provided by the client and/or the Business Analyst.

Requirements:

- Web/Mobile Interface: Develop a web/mobile interface where patients can browse available doctors, book appointments, and attend video consultations. Ensure the interface is user-friendly and supports various devices.

- Patient Management Service: Implement a service where patients can register, manage their profiles, upload medical reports/documents, and view their medical history and past prescriptions.
    - Patient role – Register, manage profile, book appointments, upload reports, view prescriptions, attend video consultations.
    - Admin role – Manage user accounts, verify doctor registrations, and oversee platform operations and financial transactions.

- Doctor Management Service: Develop a service where doctors can manage their profiles, set availability schedules, conduct video consultations, and issue digital prescriptions.
    - Doctor role – Manage profile and availability, accept/reject appointment requests, conduct telemedicine sessions, issue digital prescriptions, and view patient-uploaded reports.

- Appointment Service: Implement a service that allows patients to search for doctors by specialty, book appointments, modify or cancel bookings, and track appointment status in real time.

- Telemedicine Service (Video Session Integration): Implement a secure video consultation module that enables patients and doctors to connect in real time. Integrate a third-party video/conferencing API such as Agora, Twilio, or Jitsi Meet.

- Payment Service: Integrate secure online payment gateways for consultation fees. Use Sri Lankan third-party services such as PayHere, Dialog Genie, or FriMi (or internationally recognized services such as Stripe or PayPal (sandbox environment)).

- Notification Service: Upon successful appointment booking or consultation completion, patients and doctors should receive confirmation via SMS and email. Utilize third-party SMS and email services for sending notifications.

- AI Symptom Checker Service (Optional Enhancement): Develop an optional AI-powered service where patients can input their symptoms and receive preliminary health suggestions and recommended doctor specialties. Integrate a suitable AI/ML API or model for this purpose.

You may add new functionalities other than those mentioned in the description.

Implementation:

1. Based on the provided requirements, develop a set of RESTful web services to implement the healthcare platform. You may choose any technology stack to implement the services. Ensure the services are designed following REST principles, maintaining scalability, security, and performance.

2. You must use the Microservices architecture to develop/integrate the API. Ensure that you use Docker and Kubernetes. If you are using any other tool for Microservices orchestration/integration, you may justify that in the report and during the viva.

3. Develop an asynchronous web client using any JavaScript framework that supports asynchronous programming (such as Angular, React, etc.) or use regular jQuery + AJAX. However, for the scope of this assignment, implementing just an asynchronous web client is sufficient.

4. Use appropriate security/authentication mechanisms to uniquely identify each user and authenticate them. There should be three roles:
    - Patient – Browse doctors, book appointments, attend video consultations, upload medical reports, and receive prescriptions.
    - Doctor – Manage availability, conduct consultations, and issue digital prescriptions, view patient records.
    - Admin – Manage user accounts, verify doctor registrations, and handle platform operations.

Deliverables:

1. A text file called submission.txt, containing a GitHub repository link with all the source code. The source code should contain the backend services, client, and any other relevant source/resource files (e.g., database scripts), arranged in a proper directory structure.

2. The submission.txt should contain a YouTube video link of a presentation/demo of the project. Each member may use a maximum of 3 minutes to explain their contribution, so the total video length should not exceed 12 minutes.

3. A readme.txt document, listing down the steps to deploy the above deliverables.

4. A members.txt file, containing the names, registration numbers, and the IDs of the group members.

5. A report in PDF format (report.pdf). The report should include:
    - A high-level architectural diagram showing the services and their interconnectivity.
    - A list of interfaces (NOT the user interfaces, but the service interfaces) exposed by each service.
    - A brief explanation of each workflow used in the system (you may use design diagrams of your choice to do this).
    - Details about authentication/security mechanisms adopted.
    - Individual contributions of each group member.

You may use code snippets in the report to explain the above.

The report must have an appendix with all the code that you have written (excluding the auto-generated code). Do not paste screenshots of the code in the appendix; instead, copy the code as text. If screenshots are added in the appendix, only the minimum mark may be offered.

Note: All reports will be uploaded to Turnitin for plagiarism checking. If the Turnitin similarity is above 20%, marks will be penalized.

Submission Details:

- All files should be uploaded in a single ZIP archive. The ZIP file name should be Group ID_DS-Assignment.zip. Only one member needs to upload the submission.
- Submission Deadline: 11th week of the semester.
